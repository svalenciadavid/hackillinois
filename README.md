HACKILLINOIS PROJECT

# PROJECT_BAT
A learning experience on Unity. Being beginners we hope to get some experience working in Unity. When it's all done we can expand and maybe create a better project with what we've learned.

The concept of this game is for it to be a fighting game inspired by Lethal League but in a top-down 2D view


We are going for this type of top-down view with a bit of prespective

Game Mechanics:
Just like lethal league, we want the focus of the game to be centered around players trading hits with the ball as it climbs up to unbelievable speeds.

Goals for the Hackathon:
* Starting UI that leads to a character select screen. (For now we can assume we have 1 character archtype)
* A player that interacts with a ball on screen. The player and the ball are affected by eachother, that is, the player hits the ball and increases its speed, the ball hurts the player it hits.
* A UI that displays player health.
* Two players w/controller inputs'

Important design:
- We want the ball to be outlined so that it's easy to see as it gains speed.
- It should be clear to the player the range of their attack (the batting) and their hurtbox

Stretch goals:
* More attack options, like bunting which allow for mix-ups in the ball speed, grab.
* Options while ball is in hitstun like lethal league blaze incorporates (parry)
* As ball gets faster there is a grace period where the ball stops before it launches (hitstun)
* More players in the select screen
* More movement options, and more maps with variations in obstructions, more surfaces for the ball to bounce on

Here are the moves in lethal league blaze. For reference, the goal is to try to incorporate some of the essential moves and adapt others to a 2D top down view. We can experiment with certain moves in LLB to try and see if they would fit the top-down gameplay, but it will be better, as stretch goals, to come up with our own moves with what we think might fit better.

Current Workflow:
David - Documentation, management, In-Game UI
Santiago - Player work and interactions with the ball
Francisco - Art/ animation -> transition to working on other game components.
Yong - Start screen, transition to player select scene.
