HACKILLINOIS PROJECT

# PROJECT_BAT
A learning experience on Unity. Being beginners we hope to get some experience working in Unity. When it's all done we can expand and maybe create a better project with what we've learned.

The concept of this game is for it to be a fighting game inspired by Lethal League but in a top-down 2D view


We are going for this type of top-down view with a bit of prespective

Game Mechanics:
Just like lethal league, we want the focus of the game to be centered around players trading hits with the ball as it climbs up to unbelievable speeds.

Goals for the Hackathon:
* Starting UI that leads to a character select screen. (For now we can assume we have 1 character archtype)
* A player that interacts with a ball on screen. The player and the ball are affected by eachother, that is, the player hits the ball and increases its speed, the ball hurts the player it hits.
* A UI that displays player health.
* Two players w/controller inputs
